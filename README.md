# Crypto Trading Calculator

## v1.6.4 (Hotfix)

- Restored **real Settings** window (General + API Keys) and restored **language setting** (top bar + Settings). 
- Fixed dark theme consistency by replacing white system dialogs with themed windows.
- Fixed auto-update reliability: update is staged to `main_update.py` and applied via an external script after app exits.
- History and chart windows are back (History table + equity curve from saved trades).

Data is stored in: `C:\Users\<YOU>\.crypto_calculator\` on Windows.
